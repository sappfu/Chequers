        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Chequers will be used by the University of Texas at Arlington’s College of Engineering for recruiting and
        outreach
        purposes.The purpose of the project is to showcase the checkers-playing robot to inspire potential future
        students
        and provide a source of public relations for the University of Texas at Arlington. As the Chequers system will
        be
        used for demonstration purposes for the university, it should be interesting enough to encourage people to
        continue
        playing.

        <h2> Description </h2>
        The robot system, which has been named Chequers, will use a vision subsystem to determine the state of the board
        and
        an Artificial Intelligent (AI) subsystem to determine which moves the robot will make during the game. When
        making a
        move, the robot arm will be able to move a piece to the correct square, jump over the human player’s pieces,
        remove
        captured pieces from the board, and crown the human player’s piece, as per the rules of the game. The human
        player
        will be able to manually move their pieces, after which, the vision subsystem will check the state of the board,
        verifying that the move was legal, and allow the AI to determine the next move. The whole system should not be
        more
        than 2’l x 2’w x 1.5’h, and will have a budget of $800.
        As the Chequers system will be used for demonstration purposes for the university, it will be required to have a
        polished look. The user interface may include voice recognition and speech. Chequers will have multiple levels
        of AI
        difficulty to make it fun for players of different skill levels. All features of the project are defined in the
        System Requirements Specification.
        The system will need to be reasonably easy to transport by car or van, and have a short setup time. Due to the
        nature of the project, the system will need to be robust enough to withstand multiple breakdowns and setups.

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        This section gives a general description of each of the five high level layers of the system, and each subsystem
        within those layers. These layers include the Presentation Layer, Central Controller Layer, Processing Layer,
        Persistence Layer, and Hardware Layer. Figure 1.0 shows the architecture of the Chequers system, which includes
        each layer, subsystem, and data flows.

        <h2> Hardware </h2>
        The Raspberry Pi is the center of the system and is responsible for processing data acquired and sending
        coordinates to the Iduino. I/O devices and other hardware devices will be connected to the Raspberry Pi,
        allowing it to interact with the physical world.
